# EmployeemanagementSB
created an employee management  API using Spring boot and postman with CRUD functionality



Why are we doing this?
As im new to learning the spirng framework and java using the skills we have learned to create this project really helped undesrstand the technology amd how it can be used to create other awesome projects 

How i expected the challenge?
As im new to the language and framework i knew it will be a challenge once i got going i had a rough idea on the way learnt alot by fixing errors but this is the beginning and has motivated me to create more projects using springboot and learning it.

What went well/what didt go as planned?

It was a rollercoaster at first knowing how to start starting the project was easy but once i started adding spring into the project i statred getting errors and small syntax mistakes which was frustrating other than that sometimes the crud fuctionality wouldnt work but at the end i manged to fix it.


Possible improvments: 
If i had more time on the project i could have tried implementing some front end to the project using HTML and CSS which would have given it a more visual side.
other improveemenr is more time in planning the project which can help.
Learn more of the framework to implement advance things to it.
